# Runtime controls for the bridge axioms

`LeanIn/Theory/Bridge.lean` asserts seven claims about the running `Std` primitives. An axiom nobody
checks is a liability, so each gets a control here — a test that distinguishes "the claim holds" from
"it does not".

Not all seven can be tested, and saying which is part of the point:

* **A1, A2, A5, A7** are controlled below.
* **A3** (release requires ownership) cannot be *tested*, because violating it is undefined behaviour
  — the test would be the defect. It is discharged by reading `mutex.cpp` plus the standard, and the
  model expresses the constraint by having no transition for it.
* **A4** (spurious wakeups) cannot be *forced*: the implementation is permitted to wake spuriously, not
  obliged to. The control is therefore a tolerance test — a `waitUntil`-shaped loop must survive a
  wakeup it did not ask for — rather than an observation of one.
* **A6** is absent from v1 (D2, D11).

Every control prints what it observed rather than only pass/fail, because A1 is a *race*: a lost update
is expected but not guaranteed on any given run, and a control that claimed otherwise would be lying.

/-- **A2.** `tryLock` returns `false` on a held lock and `true` on a free one, and does not block
doing it.

The `tryLock` must come from a *different* thread than the holder: `std::mutex::try_lock` on a mutex
already locked by the calling thread is undefined behaviour, so the naive control would be the defect
it is meant to detect. -/

  IO.println s!"      it took is mostly the thread round-trip and proves nothing on its own"

/-- **A5.** A notification with no waiter is lost.

Issue `notifyOne` before anyone is waiting, then park a waiter and check — after a generous delay —
that it is still parked. Then `notifyAll` and check that it resumes. The first half is the claim; the
second half is the affirmative control, showing the machinery does wake a waiter when it is told to. -/

/-- **A1.** Mutual exclusion is load-bearing.

Four threads each increment a counter `iters` times. Unguarded, increments are lost to the race;
guarded, the total is exact.

The guarded half is the **affirmative control**: it shows the lock is doing the work, so the unguarded
loss is attributable to the missing lock rather than to the counter not existing. The unguarded half is
probabilistic — a race need not manifest — so the observed count is printed rather than asserted. -/

        m.atomically do set ((← get) + 1)) Task.Priority.dedicated)
  for t in guarded do let _ ← IO.wait t
  let exact ← m.atomically get

  let expected := threads * iters
  IO.println s!"  A1  {threads} threads x {iters} increments = {expected} expected"

  return (raw, exact)

/-- **A4, as far as it can be controlled.** A wakeup that was never asked for must not corrupt a
`waitUntil`-shaped loop: the predicate is re-checked, so an unexpected resume just re-parks.

This does *not* observe a spurious wakeup — the implementation is permitted to wake spuriously, not
obliged to. It shows the shape the theory demands is the shape that tolerates one. -/

/-- **SC1 — the awaiter yields to a sibling on the invoking caller before the gated wake.**

One `blockOn` on the invoking thread. The awaited body and the sibling are both polled on that same
caller — the single-carrier claim — while the completion is a stock `Task` completing on a pool worker,
which is the *native* waker and must be a different thread. The gate is a mutex/condvar handshake
between the sibling and that completion, so the order is not decided by elapsed time.

The events are appended by the actor that caused them, where it occurred, and nothing retypes them from
a desired result: the awaiter appends `await-registered` on its first poll, the sibling appends its two,
and the completion's continuation appends the last when it resumes. -/

/-- **SC3 — the executor's operation records against the pure model's.**

The script is `tests/ModelOracle.lean`'s, repeated here because that oracle is a fixture outside the library
and cannot be imported; the fixture checks that both sides produce the same number of records, and it is
nine. Each outcome is *computed* from the executor's own state after the transaction, exactly as the oracle's
is computed from the model's — neither side types an expected answer, so a match is evidence about the
executor rather than agreement between two copies of a fixture.

`take` advances the pool and the scheduler together or neither, and the record says which: a task with
`taken<n>`, or `-` with `none`. -/
