# Runtime controls for the bridge axioms

`LeanIn/Theory/Bridge.lean` asserts seven claims about the running `Std` primitives. An axiom nobody
checks is a liability, so each gets a control here — a test that distinguishes "the claim holds" from
"it does not".

Not all seven can be tested, and saying which is part of the point:

* **A1, A2, A5, A7** are controlled below.
* **A3** (release requires ownership) cannot be *tested*, because violating it is undefined behaviour
  — the test would be the defect. It is discharged by reading `mutex.cpp` plus the standard, and the
  model expresses the constraint by having no transition for it.
* **A4** (spurious wakeups) cannot be *forced*: the implementation is permitted to wake spuriously, not
  obliged to. The control is therefore a tolerance test — a `waitUntil`-shaped loop must survive a
  wakeup it did not ask for — rather than an observation of one.
* **A6** is absent from v1 (D2, D11).

Every control prints what it observed rather than only pass/fail, because A1 is a *race*: a lost update
is expected but not guaranteed on any given run, and a control that claimed otherwise would be lying.

/-- **A2.** `tryLock` returns `false` on a held lock and `true` on a free one, and does not block
doing it.

The `tryLock` must come from a *different* thread than the holder: `std::mutex::try_lock` on a mutex
already locked by the calling thread is undefined behaviour, so the naive control would be the defect
it is meant to detect. -/
def controlTryLock : IO Unit := do
  let m ← Std.BaseMutex.new

  IO.println s!"      it took is mostly the thread round-trip and proves nothing on its own"

/-- **A5.** A notification with no waiter is lost.

Issue `notifyOne` before anyone is waiting, then park a waiter and check — after a generous delay —
that it is still parked. Then `notifyAll` and check that it resumes. The first half is the claim; the
second half is the affirmative control, showing the machinery does wake a waiter when it is told to. -/

/-- **A1.** Mutual exclusion is load-bearing.

Four threads each increment a counter `iters` times. Unguarded, increments are lost to the race;
guarded, the total is exact.

The guarded half is the **affirmative control**: it shows the lock is doing the work, so the unguarded
loss is attributable to the missing lock rather than to the counter not existing. The unguarded half is
probabilistic — a race need not manifest — so the observed count is printed rather than asserted. -/

  let expected := threads * iters

  IO.println s!"  A1  guarded   → {exact}  exact = {exact == expected}  (affirmative control)"
  return (raw, exact)

/-- **A4, as far as it can be controlled.** A wakeup that was never asked for must not corrupt a
`waitUntil`-shaped loop: the predicate is re-checked, so an unexpected resume just re-parks.

This does *not* observe a spurious wakeup — the implementation is permitted to wake spuriously, not
obliged to. It shows the shape the theory demands is the shape that tolerates one. -/
